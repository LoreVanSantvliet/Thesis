Overview of the phaster benchmarking pipeline

# General part (not phaster-specific)

select_benchmark_genomes.sh: selects 50 genomes from the /results/intermediate/genomes_species.csv file
download_benchmark_genomes.sh: downloads multi-fasta files (genomic, GenBank) for these 50 genomes from NCBI.

# Running phaster and extracting results

01_submit_phaster.sh: submits jobs to phaster, saves output files, named <genome>_job.txt
02_get_job_ids.sh: extracts job_ids from the jobs output files, puts them in job_ids.txt file
03_status_update_phaster.sh: gets a status update on the phaster jobs, using the job_ids, and saves the output files. Ultimately, the final phaster output files will be saved in these files, named <genome>.txt.
04_remove_job_files.sh: removes the job files.

# Parsing results

fix_newline.sh: fixes newline mismatch, needs to be run as a command:
./fix_newline.sh
parse_phaster.sh: script to parse all files in the phaster_raw directory. The results are stored in the phaster_parsed directory.
